## Known Issues

### Non-Blocking
- ⚠️ Integration test files have TypeScript compilation errors (tests don't run)
  - Files: ClaimPayoutFlow.spec.ts, PolicyPurchaseFlow.spec.ts, RebalancingFlow.spec.ts
  - Issue: Missing/incorrect type definitions (HedgeStatus.ACTIVE, etc.)
  - Impact: Zero - these are skeleton files for future E2E testing

### Future Enhancements
- 📋 E2E test suite for full user journeys
- 📋 Performance testing for high-load scenarios
- 📋 Security audit preparation documentation
- 📋 Mainnet deployment checklist
