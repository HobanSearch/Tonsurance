## Overview

Successfully built the complete Phase 4 Hedged Insurance system for Tonsurance, including:
- 3 smart contracts (FunC)
- 5 off-chain services (TypeScript)
- 1 keeper service
- Comprehensive test suites (70+ tests)
- Mock APIs for testing
- Test fixtures with realistic data

---

## Smart Contracts (FunC)

### 1. PricingOracle.fc
**Location**: `contracts/hedged/PricingOracle.fc`

**Purpose**: Stores real-time hedge costs from 3 external venues

**Key Features**:
- Updates hedge prices every 5 seconds via authorized keepers
- Stores prices for 3 coverage types (DEPEG, EXPLOIT, BRIDGE)
- 3 hedge sources: Polymarket odds, Perpetual funding rates, Allianz quotes
- Staleness protection (rejects data >5 min old)
- `calculate_hedge_cost()` method computes total hedge cost

**Test Coverage**: 40+ unit tests in `tests/unit/contracts/hedged/PricingOracle.spec.ts`

**Key Methods**:
```func
() update_hedge_prices(int coverage_type, int polymarket_odds, int perp_funding_rate, int allianz_quote)
int calculate_hedge_cost(int coverage_type, int coverage_amount, int duration_days) method_id
```

---

### 2. HedgeCoordinator.fc
**Location**: `contracts/hedged/HedgeCoordinator.fc`

**Purpose**: Tracks hedge positions per policy and coordinates liquidation

**Key Features**:
- Tracks hedges across 3 venues per policy
- Registers hedge execution from keepers
- Coordinates hedge liquidation when claims approved
- Refills Reserve vault from liquidation proceeds
- Supports concurrent liquidation of all 3 venues

**Test Coverage**: 30+ unit tests in `tests/unit/contracts/hedged/HedgeCoordinator.spec.ts`

**Key Methods**:
```func
() register_hedge(int policy_id, int venue_id, int amount, slice external_id, int status)
() liquidate_hedges(int policy_id, slice polymarket_keeper, slice perp_keeper, slice allianz_keeper)
() report_liquidation(int policy_id, int venue_id, int proceeds, slice reserve_vault)
```

---

### 3. HedgedPolicyFactory.fc
**Location**: `contracts/hedged/HedgedPolicyFactory.fc`

**Purpose**: Creates policies with dynamic swing pricing

**Key Features**:
- Calculates premium = base (0.8% APR) + hedge costs (from oracle)
- 30-second premium quote validity window
- Async hedge execution via 3 keepers (Polymarket, Perps, Allianz)
- Pool capacity management (80% max utilization)
- 20/40/40 hedge allocation (Allianz 20%, Polymarket 40%, Perps 40%)

**Key Methods**:
```func
() create_hedged_policy(slice user_addr, int coverage_type, int coverage_amount, int duration_days, int expected_premium, int quote_timestamp)
```

---

## Off-Chain Services (TypeScript)

### 1. RiskCalculator
**Location**: `hedging/services/RiskCalculator.ts`

**Purpose**: Calculate total exposure by coverage type and hedge requirements

**Key Methods**:
```typescript
async calculateExposure(): Promise<ExposureByType[]>
async needsRebalancing(): Promise<boolean>
async calculateRebalanceOrders(): Promise<HedgeOrder[]>
```

**Features**:
- Aggregates all active policies by coverage type
- Calculates required hedge (20% of total coverage)
- Determines hedge deficit/surplus
- Generates rebalance orders when deficit >5%

---

### 2. HedgeOptimizer
**Location**: `hedging/services/HedgeOptimizer.ts`

**Purpose**: Optimize hedge allocation across 3 venues based on cost/liquidity

**Key Methods**:
```typescript
optimizeAllocation(opts: { totalHedgeNeeded, marketData, constraints }): HedgeAllocation
calculateHedgeROI(opts: { venue, coverageType, amount, duration }): HedgeROI
```

**Features**:
- Allocates hedges by cost efficiency (cheapest venues first)
- Respects capacity constraints per venue
- Enforces diversification (min 15%, max 50% per venue)
- Calculates expected ROI and expected value

---

### 3. PolymarketConnector
**Location**: `hedging/services/PolymarketConnector.ts`

**Purpose**: Execute hedges on Polymarket prediction markets

**Key Methods**:
```typescript
async placeOrder(opts: { coverageType, amount, side, type }): Promise<PolymarketOrderResult>
async liquidatePosition(opts: { externalId, amount }): Promise<{ proceeds, slippage }>
async getMarketData(coverageType): Promise<{ probability, cost, capacity, confidence }>
```

**Features**:
- RESTful API integration with Polymarket CLOB
- Rate limit handling (429 retry with exponential backoff)
- Market mapping (coverageType → market ID)
- Order execution (YES/NO sides, MARKET/LIMIT types)

---

### 4. PricingOracleKeeper
**Location**: `hedging/keepers/PricingOracleKeeper.ts`

**Purpose**: Update PricingOracle every 5 seconds with latest hedge costs

**Key Methods**:
```typescript
start(): void  // Start keeper (updates every 5s)
stop(): void   // Stop keeper
async updatePrices(): Promise<void>  // Manual trigger
```

**Features**:
- Fetches hedge costs from 3 sources:
  - Polymarket: Market odds via API
  - Perpetuals: Funding rate (mocked, would be Binance API)
  - Allianz: Parametric quote (mocked, would be Allianz API)
- Converts to basis points and updates oracle
- Handles API failures gracefully (uses defaults)
- Runs on configurable interval (default 5000ms)

---

## Architecture Summary

### Data Flow: Policy Purchase
```
1. User requests quote → Frontend calls GET /premium/swing-quote
2. API fetches latest hedge costs from PricingOracle (on-chain)
3. Calculate total premium = base + Σ(hedge costs), cache 30s
4. User approves → TX to HedgedPolicyFactory.create_hedged_policy()
5. Factory creates policy, sends async messages to 3 keepers
6. User receives policy confirmation (<5 sec)
7. Keepers execute hedges in parallel (5-10 sec):
   - PolymarketKeeper: Buy YES shares
   - PerpKeeper: Open short position
   - AllianzKeeper: Bind parametric coverage
8. Keepers report back to HedgeCoordinator with external order IDs
9. User sees hedge status via WebSocket
```

### Data Flow: Claim Payout (Hedged Policy)
```
1. Claim approved by ClaimsEngine
2. Pay 100% to user IMMEDIATELY:
   - 80% from PrimaryVault
   - 20% from Reserve (temporary float)
3. Total payout time: <5 seconds
4. SIMULTANEOUSLY trigger hedge liquidation:
   - Send liquidation orders to 3 keepers
5. Hedge settlements arrive (30s - 5 min):
   - Polymarket: Instant (sell YES shares)
   - Perpetuals: Instant (close short)
   - Allianz: 3-5 days (parametric payout)
6. HedgeCoordinator receives proceeds, refills Reserve vault
7. Net result: User paid instantly, Reserve self-heals
```

### Capital Allocation (80/20 Split)

For $10M total coverage:

**On-Chain (80% = $8M)**:
- Primary Vault: $4.5M (45%)
- Secondary Vault: $2M (20%)
- TradFi Buffer: $1M (10%)
- Reserve: $2.5M (25%)

**External Hedges (20% = $2M)**:
- Polymarket: $800k (40% of hedges)
- Perpetuals: $800k (40%)
- Allianz: $400k (20%)

**Capital Efficiency**: 250% (vs. 200% Core Insurance, 100-150% traditional)

    oracleAddress: Address.parse('EQC...'),
    keeperWallet: myWallet,
    polymarketConnector: new PolymarketConnector({ ... }),
    updateInterval: 5000, // 5 seconds
});

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Two-Product Architecture**: Core (100% on-chain) + Hedged (80/20 split) as separate products
2. **Swing Pricing**: Dynamic premiums updated every 5s based on hedge costs
3. **80/20 Split**: Balances decentralization (80% on-chain) with capital efficiency (20% hedges)
4. **Async Hedge Execution**: Fast policy creation (<5s), hedges execute in background
5. **Concurrent Claim Payout**: User paid instantly from Reserve, hedges liquidate to refill
6. **Test-First**: Comprehensive tests before implementation (following TDD)
